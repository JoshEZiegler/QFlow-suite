Details about the original dataset, as used in QFlow-lite, can be found in J. P. Zwolak *et. al*, [QFlow lite dataset: A machinelearning approach to the charge states in quantum
dot experiments.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205844) PLoS ONE **13**(10): e0205844 (2018).

The dataset incorporating physical noise is discussed in J. Ziegler *et. al*, Toward Robust Autotuning of Noisy Quantum Dot Devices. [arXiv:2108.00043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00043) (2021).
